##  Overview
This repository serves as a testing ground for **quantitative trading strategies** and **financial automation tools**. It documents my ongoing research into market microstructure, technical analysis, and algorithmic execution using Python.

The goal of this project is to engineer robust trading logic, optimize parameters via backtesting, and analyze risk-adjusted returns.

## 📂 Project Structure

| Directory | Description | Key Libraries |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| `/Mean_Reversion` | Strategies based on Bollinger Bands and RSI mean reversion logic. | `pandas`, `yfinance` |
| `/Momentum_Strategies` | Trend-following algorithms using MACD and Moving Averages. | `ta-lib`, `numpy` |
| `/Market_Data_Pipelines` | Scripts for fetching and cleaning OHLCV data from financial APIs. | `requests`, `json` |
| `/Backtesting_Engine` | Custom logic to simulate trades against historical data. | `matplotlib`, `scipy` |

## 🚀 Key Features implemented
* **Technical Indicator Integration:** Automated calculation of RSI, MACD, SMA/EMA, and Bollinger Bands.
* **Backtesting Framework:** Simulation of buy/sell signals on historical data (2020-2024) to evaluate Drawdown and Sharpe Ratio.
* **Risk Management:** Logic for Stop-Loss and Take-Profit execution.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
* **Core:** Python 3.x
* **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Plotly
* **APIs:** YFinance (Yahoo Finance), Alpha Vantage (Experimental)
